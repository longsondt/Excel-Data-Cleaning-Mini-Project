## Introduction
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use Excel tools and advanced functions to perform data cleaning. There are two datasets in this project. For each dataset, I have included the original file, as well as a CLEANED version.

Two *Notes* file that contain the URL to the data source, and specific details of 
the cleaning operations that were done to each dataset have also been included. 

## Quick Summary 
The datasets are about Melbourne housing information, which was created in 2017, and another one about trending Youtube videos in the U.S, which was last updated in 2018. 

Without going into details, the cleaning operations that were performed includes: 
* Spell checking
* Removing duplicate rows
* Removing extra space and non printing characters with TRIM and CLEAN
* Applied number/custom formatting to monterary values or numbers
* Modify entire column values by using advanced functions such as CONCAT
